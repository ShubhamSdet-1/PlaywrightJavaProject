# Playwright Java Project

## Overview
This project is a Playwright automation framework for testing a web application. It uses Java as the programming language, Maven for build management, and TestNG for testing. The project is designed with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, providing modular and maintainable test code.

## Project Structure

### 1. Configuration Files
- **.classpath & .project**: Eclipse project configuration files.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file managing dependencies and build settings.
- **config/config.properties**: Contains environment settings and other configuration details.
- **config/locator_config.properties**: Stores locators for web elements used in tests.

### 2. Source Code

#### Main Application
- **PlaywrightPagefactory.java**: A factory class responsible for managing Playwright page objects.

#### Page Objects (POM)
- **Homepage.java**: Represents the Home page of the web application.
- **Loginpage.java**: Represents the Login page of the web application.

#### Test Code
- **BaseTest.java**: Base class that sets up and tears down the test environment.
- **HomepageTest.java**: Contains test cases for the Home page.
- **LoginPageTest.java**: Contains test cases for the Login page.

### 3. Test Output
- **test-output/**: This directory contains reports and logs generated by TestNG after running the tests. It includes:
  - **HTML Reports**: Detailed test execution reports.
  - **Screenshots**: Images showing the results of failed/passed/skipped tests.
  - **JUnit Reports**: XML-based test reports.
